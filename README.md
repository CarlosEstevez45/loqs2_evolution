# Neofunctionalization driven by positive selection led to the origin and retention of loqs2: a germline specific antiviral dsRNA binding protein in Aedes mosquitoes

Code used to analyze mRNAseq, small RNAseq and Exome-seq libraries to characterize the origin and evolution of loqs2. Further information can be found in Estevez-Castro et al. bioRxiv 2021. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.21.473503.

The dependencies to run the scripts are listed inside each file.
